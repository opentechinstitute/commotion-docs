<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Open community wireless networks digitally connect communities, and allow neighbors to share Internet access or use locally hosted applications. Neighbors are linked from rooftop to rooftop using wireless equipment. </p>

<p>Ownership and management duties are distributed among the community.<p>

<p>Community networks are built by a coalition of community anchor institutions, community-based organizations, municipal representatives, and individuals working together to plan, design, and deploy a network.  </p>

<p><strong>Digital Stewards are community members that take care of the network.</strong></p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<h3>A network can distribute and share Internet access from one gateway.</h3>

<p><img src="/files/cck/about-community-wireless/one-gateway.png" style="background-color:white; padding:10px;"></p>

<h3>Or, from multiple gateways.</h3>

<p><img src="/files/cck/about-community-wireless/multi-gateways.png" style="background-color:white; padding:10px;"></p>

<h3>A network can distribute local applications from one local server.</h3>

<h3>Or, from multiple servers across.</h3>

<h2>What skills do we need?</h2>
<p>Community wireless networks require many different skills. For example, artists and designers popularize the network, electricians and handy-people teach others how to mount routers on buildings, organizers talk to people about the network and hold public meetings, technogists create local applications, community members host equipment on the roof or in their window. Everyone has an important skill to offer. </p>

<h2>How do we get started?</h2>
<p>Each network will have their own process, but these steps are an example of how you might get started:
<ol>
  <li><strong>Identify Community Partners and Define Partnership</strong><br />
  The essential step is to decide which partners will develop, plan and maintain the network.</li>
  <li><strong>Outreach and Planning</strong><br />
  <a href="/docs/cck/planning/survey-your-neighbors" style="font-weight:normal">Surveys</a>, community meetings, and transparent or participatory budgeting can ensure that the network gets local support.  Manage expectations by presenting the project as a collaborative effort, not a free service.</li>
  <li><strong>Plan the Network Together</strong><br />
  <a href="/docs/cck/planning/design-your-network-every-network-tells-story" style="font-weight:normal">Plan</a> the initial network to connect key locations in the community.</li>
  <li><strong>Organize Digital Stewards to Manage the Network</strong><br />
  For long-term sustainability, think early on about who will handle maintenance and troubleshooting.</li>
  <li><strong>Installation</strong><br />
  OTI has simple guides for <a href="/docs/cck/installing-configuring" style="font-weight:normal">installing</a> Commotion software onto routers and <a href="/docs/cck/building-mounting" style="font-weight:normal">mounting</a> the routers onto rooftops.
</li>
</ol>

  <li>Community-based organizations</li>
  <li>Businesses</li>
  <li>Municipal governments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Commotion Construction Kit</h2>
<p><a href="/docs/cck">The Commotion Construction Kit</a> includes activities you can use in your communities to help plan, build and govern the network together.</p>

<p>There is no one right way to move through the activities. You will find tools to help you organize with others in your neighborhood to <a href="/docs/cck/planning">plan</a>, <a href="/docs/cck/building-mounting">build</a>, and <a href="/docs/cck/planning/get-word-out-flyer-design">promote</a> the network. The modules are designed to be used by individuals and groups for self-guided learning or to teach workshops or trainings. Start to explore anywhere and let us know how it goes for you.</p>
