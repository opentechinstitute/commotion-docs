#State SCSS Rules

From [Scalable & Modular Architecture for CSS](https://smacss.com/book/type-state)

A state is something that augments and overrides all other styles. For example, an accordion section may be in a collapsed or expanded state. A message may be in a success or error state.

States are generally applied to the same element as a layout rule or applied to the same element as a base module class.
