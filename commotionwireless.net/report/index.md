<h2>When to report a bug</h2>

<h3>Verify what you found is actually a bug</h3>
<p>When you experience a bug you should search the mailing list archives to see if someone has experienced the same issue you have come across. Many times what seems like a bug may be an opportunity for a feature that our development team has not thought of yet. If you canâ€™t decide if a issue is a bug or not, please submit it as a bug. The development community would like to know how it can make your experience better. We may not classify it as a bug internally until we are told that a behavior gets in the way of your use of the software.</p>

<h2>How to report a bug</h2>

<p>Bug reports are vital to the Commotion development process. The back-and-forth that accompanies a bug report allows the Commotion team to capture vital observations about the platform&#8217;s behavior in the field. These conversation allows the developers to improve their understanding of unexpected behavior so they can address it.</p>

<p>The aim of these conversations is to gather as much information as possible. Below is a short list of questions that will help developers recreate your experience in our laboratory.</p>
