    <title>User interface prototype: what Commotion software could look like</title>
    <link>http://commotionwireless.net/fr/blog/user-interface-prototype-what-commotion-software-could-look</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of our work to support the Commotion development process, we’ve created a user interface prototype to spark more community conversation. This is a starting point – not a final product. It’s a compilation of some of our ideas around creating the most effective and accessible Commotion experience, based on our neighborhood deployment and research with users and developers. We’d like to get your feedback on the ideas presented below. Your input will drive our next phase, in which we will draft Human Interface Guidelines for Commotion. Take a look and submit your comments at the end of this post!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>An audit of current Commotion user interfaces</title>
    <link>http://commotionwireless.net/fr/blog/audit-current-commotion-user-interfaces</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the goal of creating both an intuitive and accessible user experience (UX) across a sampling of devices that will run Commotion, we surveyed and analyzed the current state of the existing interfaces. We deployed a test network using the three software components currently in development phases: Commotion on an Ubiquiti Picostation (router), The Guardian Project’s OLSR Mesh Tether on an Android handset (phone) and Commotion on Linux (laptop). In anticipation of The Serval Project’s forthcoming work around meshing mobile devices with Commotion, we also researched the current release of Serval Mesh. We documented each step with screenshots, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/24639042@N07/collections/72157629382917618/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;which are compiled here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the initial audit, we compared and contrasted each workflow, documenting any issues that arose during the process and were then able to make recommendations on how to improve each of the interfaces and workflows and make them consistent across platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our process was unique in that our auditors represented a range of skill levels and backgrounds. We seek to represent this diversity when creating user interfaces that are intended for a broad range of users. For example, Auditor 1 is a self-taught web developer with advanced skills in networks and mesh networks specifically. Auditor 2 is a designer with intermediate knowledge of networks and some experience setting up networks. Auditor 3 is a designer with basic network skills and very little experience setting up a network. We feel that these varied levels of experience with networking are important. The advanced user can help guide the process for successful installation and the inexperienced users can communicate what is helpful while illuminating confusing aspects of the process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Neighborhood network builders: a summary</title>
    <link>http://commotionwireless.net/fr/blog/neighborhood-network-builders-summary</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of our research for the Commotion Human Interface Guidelines, we interviewed four people who have been involved in building community wireless networks around Detroit (see earlier blog posts for excerpts). Based on these interviews and our experience working with various users, we recommend that Commotion developers and organizers implement the following concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building successful software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our interviews confirmed that users expect long-term reliability, speed, and ease of use when using wireless devices. The Commotion user interface should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk a user through the setup process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work well across platforms, browsers, and devices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be as fast as using a non-mesh WiFi access point.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help users understand mesh network security.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow for easy monitoring of network status in terms that users can understand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offer troubleshooting suggestions when a network does not work correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Integrating design and development to shape Commotion’s brand identity</title>
    <link>http://commotionwireless.net/fr/blog/integrating-design-and-development-shape-commotion%E2%80%99s-brand-identity</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;field-content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At The Work Department, we’ve had the privilege of creating Commotion’s brand identity from conception to completion. If you haven’t heard about it yet, Commotion is an open, yet secure, circumvention tool to create decentralized mesh networks. We are collaboratively developing the tool with The New America Foundation’s Open Technology Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
