Commotion is a free, open-source communication tool that uses mobile phones, computers, and other wireless devices to create decentralized mesh networks. Commotion provides a way for you to share your Internet connection with the people around you, but it is not a replacement for your Internet connection. Read more about how Commotion works on our [Frequently Asked Questions]() page.

![Mesh Networking Across Devices](houseMesh_0.png)

Wireless mesh networks allow devices to connect directly to each other without going through a centralized point. Mesh networks are self-healing and can grow organically. They also allow for easy sharing of services over the network, such as Internet and applications.
